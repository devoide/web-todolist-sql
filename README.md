Hello, this is my todolist and it's still on work. If you would like to use it you should firstly upload the documents which would be obvious and then also download the corresponding modules which can be found at the beginning of the server-side.js file. You can do this with npm (nodejs) and download it. For it also to work with sql you must have mysql or else this won't work. This project was primarily made, so I can connect to sql-databases. If you still would like to use it you need to change your user and password you have to connect into your Mysql database, you can change this in the server-side.js file. Thank you for looking here :D.
